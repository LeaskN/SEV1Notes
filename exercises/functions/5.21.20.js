// follow the instructions to create functions which manipulate and handle data

// level 1

    // Ex 1: declare a function called greeting which always returns "Hello World!"
    // Ex 2:  declare a function called goodbye which always returns "Goodbye World!"
    // Ex 3:  declare a function called test which always returns "this was a test"
    // Ex 4:  declare a function called summer which always returns "I love the sun!"
    // Ex 5:  declare a function called winter which always returns "I love the snow!"

// level 2

    // Ex 1: 
        // delcare a first variable called headmaster and set it equal to "Albus Dumbledore"
        // delcare a second variable called student and set it equal to "Hermione Granger"
        // declare a function called welcome which takes in one parameter and returns a string of `Welcome + ${parameter}!`
        // invoke the function with headmaster and log the result to the console
        // invoke the function with student and log the result to the console

    // Ex2:
        // delcare a variable called seriesOne and set it equal to "Harry Potter"
        // delcare a variable called seriesTwo and set it equal to "Lord of the Rings"
        // declare a function called favoriteSeries which takes in one parameter and returns a string of `My favorite series is + ${parameter}!`
        // invoke the function with seriesOne and log the result to the console
        // invoke the function with seriesTwo and log the result to the console

// level 3
    // Ex1:
        // delcare a variable called numberOne and set it equal to 1
        // delcare a variable called numberTwo and set it equal to 2
        // declare a function called doubleTheNumber which takes in one parameter and outputs twice that number
        // invoke the function with numberOne and log the result to the console
        // invoke the function with numberTwo and log the result to the console
// level 4
    // Ex1:
        // delcare a variable called listOfMovies and set it equal to ['Fast & Furious 2', 'Tangled', 'The Lion King', 'Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire']
        // delcare a variable called listOfBooks and set it equal to ['Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire', 'A Tale of Two Cities', 'The Book Theif', '1984']
        // declare a function called bothMovieAndBook which takes in two parameters and outputs any common features
            // For example the output here should be ['Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire']
        // invoke the function with listOfMovies and listOfBooks and log the result to the console
